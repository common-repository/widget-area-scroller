Make your widget area scrollable in just 5 clicks!

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to make scrollable panels out of your widgets. Checkout the screenshots.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Goto Appearance -> Widget Area Scroller and activate the scroller effect on widget area(s).
4. Enjoy!

== Screenshots ==

1. First on the plugin's option page, choose which widget area(s) you want to apply the scroller effect. Also provide a fixed height for the scrolling panels. You can leave it blank if you have specified a fixed height in your theme's stylesheet.
2. Goto the Widgets page and add a couple of widgets to that widget area. Use the Area Scroller :: Divider widget to divide the widgets in multiple panels.
3. Voila! That was it. The default skin provided with the plugin shows the next & prev buttons beside the widget area. To arrange the widgets in multiple columns, I'm using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widgets-in-columns/">Widgets in Columns</a> plugin.
